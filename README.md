Library of Ruina mod (WIP)

Goal is to rework the game and add Limbus Company content.

Contains Audio and Sprites from Library of Ruina and Limbus Company

Audio bitrate had to be reduced significantly. Some sprites had to be edited to more accurately suit their context.

Standalone, doesn't need any other mods, and most likely is not compatible with any other mods.

Current content: Up to Rats/Bloodbath

More a test/code demo than a working prototype.
